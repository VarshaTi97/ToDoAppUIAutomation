## ToDoList App Automated Functional Tests ##

This is a maven project repository which contains the test scripts, page objects, and test data for testing functional flows of ToDoApp. It is a hybrid driven framework which incorporates data driven approach along with different design patterns like Singleton and POM.
These scripts test functional workflows on popular web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome
Target URL is: https://todomvc.com/examples/angular2/

### Repo organization ###
This repository contains the following directories:

   ```
   |____src/main/java
   | |____base
   | |____constants
   | |____listeners
   | |____pages
   | |____reporting

   |____src/test/java
   | |____testScripts
   |
   |____resources
   | |____testdata
   |
   |____reports
   ```

1. **testScripts** - Contains java test automation scripts to implement test steps for various test scenarios under 
todo application.
   Examples:
   ```
   |____testScripts
   | |____BaseTest.java
   | |____HomePageTest.java
   ```

2. **pages** - Tests are designed based on the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. Under this model, each web page 
has a corresponding `page class` containing `page methods` which perform operations on page specific `WebElements`. 
Each web page under ToDo application has a dedicated page object `.java` file available under this directory. 
Every page class follows `Singleton` design pattern.
   Examples:
   ```
   |____pages
   | |____HomePage.java
   ```

3. **base** - Contains wrapper class implementing all the built-in selenium methods.
   Examples:
   ```
